## How It Works

The main page shows all the games as cards. When you click on a game, it loads that game's page inside an iframe below the menu.

Each game lives in its own folder inside the `games` directory, so adding new games is easy.

## How to Add a New Game

1. Create a new folder inside the `games` folder.
2. Add your game files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, etc.) inside that folder.
3. Update the main `script.js` file to add your game name and path.
4. Add a new game card in `index.html` with the matching `data-game` attribute.
5. Done! Your game will show up on the menu and be playable.
